# SIGINT

I was not happy about how to add some time.

You can now call `userlimit1.pl --addtime user1,30m`.
But create a directory `/var/spool/userlimit` first.

The command will place a ticket in that directory and send a INT signal to the daemon.
The daemon will find the ticket an top up the limit.
